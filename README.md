This project aims to predict insurance claim costs using a supervised machine learning model. The dataset contains anonymized information about claims, and the primary task is to estimate the final claim loss. The project utilizes XGBoost, a popular gradient boosting algorithm, for regression tasks. Alongside predictive modeling, the project seeks to identify the key variables impacting claim costs.
